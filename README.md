# Resilience
Girls who Code project

This project is a website raising awareness about the mental health crisis accompanying the climate crisis. It includes useful links to articles about the issue and places where you can seek help for climate anxiety, as well as a chatbot to practice having conversations about climate anxiety and doom.
