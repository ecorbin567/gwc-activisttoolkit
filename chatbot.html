		<h2>Now it's your turn to help others!</h2><br>
    <p align="center">When a friend or family member is struggling with their feelings about the state of the world, it's hard to know what to say. Talking about the future is a harder conversation to have than ever, but it's just as important as it's always been, if not more.</p><br><p align="center">Using a simple chatbot that simulates a text conversation, you can practice helping someone through their feelings of doom, and along the way, learn about how to work through these feelings yourself.</p><br><p align="center">To interact with the chatbot, simply pick the text that you think is correct for each question and click on it. You will be able to see your friend's response to each of your answers. If you get the question wrong, you will have an opportunity to retry until you get it right.</p>
